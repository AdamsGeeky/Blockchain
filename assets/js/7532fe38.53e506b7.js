These transactions are stored on sheets or blocks in a digital ledger that is shared among the participants of the network. Consensus on the transactions brings the peer-to-peer network into an agreement. Once the agreed-upon transaction blocks are recorded in the immutable ledger, trust becomes a fundamental component built into the system.\\n\\nBlockchain is a combination of several other underlying technologies that have never been combined so successfully. Here are some features that make this new technology so revolutionary.\\n\\nA ledger is a collection of transactions. It is not a collection of assets. Assets are part of a transaction, but the ledger records the transaction. With a digitally distributed ledger or a blockchain, no one owns the ledger. The ledger is distributed among participants in the network, all running the same blockchain protocols. It is decentralized in that an identical copy of the ledger exists on every node/computer on the network. In 2008 with the publishing of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s whitepaper \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d, Bitcoin became the first application to leverage blockchain technology by recording the first asset transfer on a public blockchain ledger.\\n\\nfeatures that make blockchain revolutionary.\\n\\nBitcoin is transacted over the Bitcoin network, which is an open, public blockchain network. If you have an Internet connection and a Bitcoin wallet application, you can receive and send the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have value because it can be proven with math. Unlike banks offering centralized services, you are responsible for your cryptocurrency.\\n\\nThe ledger is stored, updated, and maintained by a peer network. Nodes form the infrastructure of a blockchain network. They store, spread and preserve the blockchain data, so a blockchain exists on nodes. All nodes on a network follow the same rules of operation or protocols, but nodes have different roles. A full node contains a copy of the blockchain protocol and transaction history of the blockchain and aids in the maintenance of the blockchain. The user node interacts with the ledger. With blockchain technology, a lack of centralized authority is replaced with a peer-to-peer network.\\n\\nBlockchain networks can be public or private. A public blockchain is open to anyone with an internet connection and the appropriate application. A private blockchain grants access and rights to its users before they can interact.\\n\\nBlockchain ledgers are different from centralized ledgers because network participants have an agreement upon what is in the identical ledger. For the blocks to be added, all the nodes in the system come to agree as to what transactions are accurate and should be added to the chain of blocks. Since there is no central authority telling the nodes which transactions are valid, a new way to reach an agreement or come to a consensus is needed.\\n\\nHow each blockchain comes to a consensus is built into the protocol, they are the rules built into the code that determines how the nodes will add ledger transactions. The Bitcoin network uses a proof-of-work consensus model. This process of building agreement among a group of mutually distrusting participants is a benefit of blockchain consensus.\\n\\nCryptography and blockchain offer a secure way to prove something is authentic. Instead of relying on third-party, trust is put into cryptographic algorithms that prove the provenance and authenticity of an attestation.\\n\\nCryptography also plays a part in another powerful feature of blockchain technology, immutability. What makes blockchain incredibly powerful is that all the blocks are linked together. With the use of a cryptographic technique called hashing, the linked information is forged so that if you go back and try to change any data on any block anywhere in the shared ledger, the link with the other copies is broken in a very obvious and easy-to-determine way. With blockchain, there is no possibility of changing the data or altering the data inside the blockchain, it is permanent.\\n\\nwhile traditional database, a system administrator oversees the ledger and can make changes."},{"id":"/caree","metadata":{"permalink":"/Blockchain/blog/caree","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/caree.md","source":"@site/blog/caree.md","title":"Career opportunities in blockchain","description":"With new technology comes new opportunities and this holds true for blockchain.

As this nascent technology matures, more positions are needed to fill this increased demand. A few of these new positions are listed here:\\n\\nEntry Level and Internship Positions\\n\\nMentorship programs and internships include assisting in the designing and developing blockchain distributed ledgers based on both public and private or permissioned blockchains. With open-source, development and success depend on an active community, Working Groups and Hackathons are available for the newcomer. Skills include basic blockchain knowledge and some familiarity with basic programming languages.\\n\\nBlockchain Architect\\n\\nFor a blockchain solution to be functional, it first needs to exist. The blockchain architect is the person or group who designs and implements the backend code of the blockchain. The blockchain architect works with blockchain engineers and technical leaders to identify the blockchain structure for specific use cases. Architects understand consensus mechanisms, cryptography systems, key management techniques and smart contract management. Qualifications include Go, Java, Javascript, or any modern programming language plus project management skills.\\n\\nBlockchain Developer\\n\\nDevelopers design, write and upload smart contracts to the blockchain. Developer design workflows that operate with blockchains and smart contracts. Responsibilities can include project design, smart contract development and implementation, front end applications design and application deployment. Skills a developer needs can include Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio, .NET, MVC, AJAX, SQL, C, Python, Solidity, C++, C#, Javascript, Node.js, JQuery, SOAP, REST, FTP, HTML, XML, XSLT, XCOD, Neural-networks, Regression, Agile Scrum, MYSQL. Solutions are developed for Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, Quorum Ripple, Corda and other distributed ledger solutions.\\n\\nBlockchain Operator\\n\\nOnce the blockchain solution is designed and built, operators can join to create the peer network mentioned previously. The role of operators (nodes) is to store copies of the ledger and keep their copy up to date by distributing transactions and new blocks throughout their network via peer-to-peer communications.\\n\\nBlockchain Regulator\\n\\nMany businesses operate under regulations regarding how their data should be stored and processed. This is the same for blockchain solutions. Regulators rarely interact with the blockchain directly, rather oversee regulatory requirements that need to be considered in blockchain development. With governments researching Central Bank Digital Currencies, governing these blockchains will become increasingly more complex.\\n\\nBlockchain Project Managers\\n\\nProject managers are the first persons in an organization who are contacted when a company wants to bring blockchain in house and adapt it to their technology platforms. Responsibilities include deciding if a blockchain solution is a good fit for a business situation. If the decision is to move forward, Project Managers would organize key players and resources needed to execute the blockchain project.\\n\\nData Storage and Processing Managers\\n\\nThe blockchain provides distributed, immutable storage with built-in integrity checking, but certain limitations exist that have to be managed. Data decisions need to be made dealing with maximum capacity based on the standard block size and block rate. Policies need to address how to provide integrity verification for large amounts of data, should data be stored off-chain with a hash of the data stored on-chain. eMembers of the peer network must execute the code to remain in sync with the current state of the network. If smart contracts commonly require large amounts of processing power to complete, devices external to the peer network may be used to augment the processing power of the network.\\n\\nBlockchain Data Scientists\\n\\nBlockchain has the ability to collect large amounts of data. The Blockchain Data Scientist collects, interprets, analyzes and manages data. Developing algorithms that can analyze patterns in large data sets, the data scientist provides insight into the data collected.\\n\\nBlockchain Quality Engineer\\n\\nThis position is responsible for ensuring quality in all areas of blockchain development, such as automation frameworks and tests, manual testing and dashboards to support mobile, web and platform engineering. A quality engineer will need to research and advise on blockchain tools and develop quality assurance (QA) automated test standards, as well as define, write and implement test automation strategies for load performance tests. Applicants may also need an engineering management MBA degree.\\n\\nBlockchain Legal Consultant or Attorney\\n\\nA blockchain legal consultant is responsible for advising companies on how to structure blockchain endeavors. Advise on how to structure and govern initial coin offerings, some of which are now coming under greater regulatory scrutiny. Attorneys will also be tasked with developing legal partnerships and contracts as blockchain technology offers \\"smart contracts\\", which are self-executing based on previously agreed terms. Duties can include designing legal partnerships that would connect the crypto ecosystem with existing financial structures, and supporting various merger-and-acquisition activities, such as negotiating and drafting legal agreements and performing due diligence on blockchain projects.\\n\\nBlockchain Web Designer\\n\\nA decentralized community needs to keep the community that supports it informed. When including the use of cryptocurrencies in your business and when launching blockchains, there will be a greater need for websites to inform customers what a company is offering. A blockchain web designer will need to come up with original concepts, creative graphics and \\"mind-blowing\\" user interfaces and dashboards to engage a diverse and inclusive community.\\n\\nBlockchain Consultants\\n\\nBlockchain consulting companies and blockchain consultants are tasked with advising companies on designing and implementing blockchain solutions. This includes the documentation and maintenance of solutions, as well as their initial implementations.\\n\\nNFT Graphics Designer\\n\\nNFT stands for a non fungible token, a special token that represents a unique ID that is linked to a piece of crypto art that cannot be replicated and is used to verify ownership of a piece. The collectable world is jumping in head first and creating non fungible tokens that represent art, music, memorializing events, newspaper articles and record releases. Designers are needed to turn these moments/media into art for the thirsty NFT market."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/Blockchain/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/welcome/img/index.md","source":"@site/blog/welcome/img/index.md","title":"Who is An Engineer","description":"An Engineer is someone who went to know how and why things work, beside been naturally curious, An Engineer A Person who Designs and Builds things to solve a specific problems","date":"2022-12-27T11:31:01.000Z","formattedDate":"December 27, 2022","tags":[{"label":"linux","permalink":"/Blockchain/blog/tags/linux"},{"label":"software","permalink":"/Blockchain/blog/tags/software"},{"label":"Engineering","permalink":"/Blockchain/blog/tags/engineering"}],"readingTime":2.305,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ADAMU MUHAMMAD MUHAMMAD","title":"Student","url":"https://github.com/AdamsGeeky","imageURL":"https://github.com/AdamsGeeky.png","key":"AdamsGeeky"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Who is An Engineer","authors":["AdamsGeeky"],"tags":["linux","software","Engineering"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Career opportunities in blockchain","permalink":"/Blockchain/blog/caree"}},"content":"![](engineer.png)\\n\\n An **Engineer** is someone who went to know **how** and **why** things work, beside been naturally curious, An **Engineer** A Person who Designs and Builds things to solve a specific problems\\n # Engineer ask 3 important question when they are working \\n 1. **what** is the problem that needs to be solved ?\\n 2. **who** has the problem that needs to be solved ?\\n 3. **why** is problem this important to solved ?    \\n \\n # Software Engineers \\n they design and Create computer system and application to solve **real world problems**\\n # Software Engineering  \\n   is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, developments,testing, and maintenance of software application.\\n      Software Engineers apply engineering principal and knowledge of computer programming language to build a software solution for end users\\n# there Tasks\\n- Evaluating and testing new software programs\\n- optimizing software for speed and scalability\\n-  writing and testing code\\n-  consulting with client, Engineers,Security specialist and other stakeholders\\n-  presenting new features to internal customers\\n  \\n# General classification of software Engineers\\n1.
