Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block, forming a chain. This structure allows blockchain technology to be resistant to tampering and revision, as once a block has been added to the chain, it is very difficult to alter or remove. blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries by providing a secure, transparent, and decentralized way to store and transfer data and assets.","slug":"/category/resource","permalink":"/Blockchain/docs/category/resource","navigation":{"next":{"title":"Basics Fundamentals","permalink":"/Blockchain/docs/category/basics-fundamentals"}}}')}}]);
