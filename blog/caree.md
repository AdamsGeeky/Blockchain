# Career opportunities in blockchain

With new technology comes new opportunities and this holds true for blockchain. As this nascent technology matures, more positions are needed to fill this increased demand. A few of these new positions are listed here:

## Entry Level and Internship Positions

Mentorship programs and internships include assisting in the designing and developing blockchain distributed ledgers based on both public and private or permissioned blockchains. With open-source, development and success depend on an active community, Working Groups and Hackathons are available for the newcomer. Skills include basic blockchain knowledge and some familiarity with basic programming languages.

## Blockchain Architect

For a blockchain solution to be functional, it first needs to exist. The blockchain architect is the person or group who designs and implements the backend code of the blockchain. The blockchain architect works with blockchain engineers and technical leaders to identify the blockchain structure for specific use cases. Architects understand consensus mechanisms, cryptography systems, key management techniques and smart contract management. Qualifications include Go, Java, Javascript, or any modern programming language plus project management skills.

## Blockchain Developer

Developers design, write and upload smart contracts to the blockchain. Developer design workflows that operate with blockchains and smart contracts. Responsibilities can include project design, smart contract development and implementation, front end applications design and application deployment. Skills a developer needs can include  Python, Solidity, C++, Javascript, Node.js,  SOAP, REST, FTP, HTML, Agile Scrum, MYSQL. Solutions are developed for Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, Quorum Ripple,and other distributed ledger solutions.

## Blockchain Operator

Once the blockchain solution is designed and built, operators can join to create the peer network mentioned previously. The role of operators (nodes) is to store copies of the ledger and keep their copy up to date by distributing transactions and new blocks throughout their network via peer-to-peer communications.

## Blockchain Regulator

Many businesses operate under regulations regarding how their data should be stored and processed. This is the same for blockchain solutions. Regulators rarely interact with the blockchain directly, rather oversee regulatory requirements that need to be considered in blockchain development. With governments researching Central Bank Digital Currencies, governing these blockchains will become increasingly more complex.

## Blockchain Project Managers

Project managers are the first persons in an organization who are contacted when a company wants to bring blockchain in house and adapt it to their technology platforms. Responsibilities include deciding if a blockchain solution is a good fit for a business situation. If the decision is to move forward, Project Managers would organize key players and resources needed to execute the blockchain project.

## Data Storage and Processing Managers

The blockchain provides distributed, immutable storage with built-in integrity checking, but certain limitations exist that have to be managed. Data decisions need to be made dealing with maximum capacity based on the standard block size and block rate. Policies need to address how to provide integrity verification for large amounts of data, should data be stored off-chain with a hash of the data stored on-chain. eMembers of the peer network must execute the code to remain in sync with the current state of the network. If smart contracts commonly require large amounts of processing power to complete, devices external to the peer network may be used to augment the processing power of the network.

## Blockchain Data Scientists

Blockchain has the ability to collect large amounts of data. The Blockchain Data Scientist collects, interprets, analyzes and manages data. Developing algorithms that can analyze patterns in large data sets, the data scientist provides insight into the data collected.

## Blockchain Quality Engineer

This position is responsible for ensuring quality in all areas of blockchain development, such as automation frameworks and tests, manual testing and dashboards to support mobile, web and platform engineering. A quality engineer will need to research and advise on blockchain tools and develop quality assurance (QA) automated test standards, as well as define, write and implement test automation strategies for load performance tests. Applicants may also need an engineering management MBA degree.

## Blockchain Legal Consultant or Attorney

A blockchain legal consultant is responsible for advising companies on how to structure blockchain endeavors. Advise on how to structure and govern initial coin offerings, some of which are now coming under greater regulatory scrutiny. Attorneys will also be tasked with developing legal partnerships and contracts as blockchain technology offers "smart contracts", which are self-executing based on previously agreed terms. Duties can include designing legal partnerships that would connect the crypto ecosystem with existing financial structures, and supporting various merger-and-acquisition activities, such as negotiating and drafting legal agreements and performing due diligence on blockchain projects.

## Blockchain Web Designer

A decentralized community needs to keep the community that supports it informed. When including the use of cryptocurrencies in your business and when launching blockchains, there will be a greater need for websites to inform customers what a company is offering. A blockchain web designer will need to come up with original concepts, creative graphics and "mind-blowing" user interfaces and dashboards to engage a diverse and inclusive community.

## Blockchain Consultants

Blockchain consulting companies and blockchain consultants are tasked with advising companies on designing and implementing blockchain solutions. This includes the documentation and maintenance of solutions, as well as their initial implementations.

## NFT Graphics Designer

NFT stands for a non fungible token, a special token that represents a unique ID that is linked to a piece of crypto art that cannot be replicated and is used to verify ownership of a piece. The collectable world is jumping in head first and creating non fungible tokens that represent art, music, memorializing events, newspaper articles and record releases. Designers are needed to turn these moments/media into art for the thirsty NFT market.
