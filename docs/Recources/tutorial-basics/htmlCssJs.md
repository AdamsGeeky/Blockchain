# HTML 

**HTML**, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to create and structure web content. 

It is the foundation of the internet and is used to create and structure web pages, allowing them to be displayed in a web browser. 

HTML uses tags to mark up content and structure, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. 

used to create and structure content on the internet. It is used to define the structure and layout of a web page, including the text, images, and other media,and to create links to other web pages.
HTML is written in the form of tags, which are surrounded by angle brackets and used 
to mark the beginning and end of an element. 

# history of html
The first version of HTML was created in 1990 by **Tim Berners-Lee**, a British computer scientist who invented the World Wide Web. He wrote the code for HTML while working at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) as a way to share scientific research with colleagues around the world.

## HTML 1.0
was released in 1993 and contained only a few basic elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. In 1995, HTML 2.0 was released, which added new features such as tables and forms.

## HTML 3.0
was released in 1996, but was quickly superseded by HTML 3.2, which included support for multimedia elements like images and video. In 1997, HTML 4.0 was released, which added support for cascading style sheets (CSS), which allowed for greater control over the appearance of web pages.

## In 1999, HTML 4.01
was released, which made small improvements to HTML 4.0 and introduced support for internationalization. In 2000, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) released XHTML 1.0, which was a more strict version of HTML that required all elements to be properly closed and written in lowercase.

## In 2004, the W3C released HTML 5,

which added new features such as the canvas element for drawing graphics, and the audio and video elements for embedding multimedia. HTML 5 also introduced new semantic elements, such as header, nav, and footer, which made it easier for search engines to understand the content of web pages.

Since its release, HTML 5 has become the standard for building modern web applications and is supported by all modern web browsers. The latest version of HTML is HTML 5.2, which was released in December 2017.
**HTML5 is currently the most widely used version of HTML.**

# html list

An HTML list is a formatting element used to create a list of items in a document. There are three types of lists:

Ordered lists: These lists are numbered and display the items in a specific order. They are created using the 
```html
<ol> tag.
```
Unordered lists: These lists use bullet points to display the items in no particular order. They are created using the
```html
 <ul> tag.
```
Definition lists: These lists display a term or phrase followed by its definition. They are created using the 
```html
<dl> tag.
```
Each list item is placed within a
```html
 <li> tag.
```  
For example, an ordered list with three items would look like this:
```html
<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
```
