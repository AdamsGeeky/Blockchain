# The first seen rule

states that a transaction is considered valid and should be added to the blockchain if it is the first instance of that transaction being broadcast to the network. This rule helps to prevent double spending, as it ensures that a transaction cannot be broadcast multiple times in an attempt to trick the network into thinking it is a valid transaction. The first seen rule is a fundamental part of the Bitcoin protocol and is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the network.
