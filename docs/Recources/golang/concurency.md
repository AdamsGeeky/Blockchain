# Concurrency 

In the context of programming, concurrency is often used to improve the performance and scalability of programs by allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, a program that performs a long-running computation can use concurrency to also handle user input or network requests while the computation is being performed.

Concurrency can be implemented in various ways in programming languages. Some programming languages, such as Go and Python, have built-in support for concurrency through the use of language constructs such as goroutines and async/await. Other languages, such as Java and C++, provide concurrency support through libraries and APIs.

It is important to note that concurrent programming can be complex and requires careful design and testing to ensure that the concurrent tasks are executed correctly and do not interfere with each other. Concurrent programs also need to be designed with proper synchronization mechanisms to ensure that shared resources are accessed in a thread-safe manner.
## Goroutines
Go is a programming language that was designed with concurrency in mind. It provides several language constructs and libraries that make it easy to write concurrent programs.

One of the main concurrency-related features of Go is the concept of goroutines. A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution that is created with the go keyword. Goroutines are multiplexed onto multiple OS threads, so they can be run concurrently and take advantage of multiple CPU cores, if available.

In Go, you can use the async and await keywords to simplify the concurrent execution of functions. These keywords are provided by the sync package and are used to implement asynchronous programming patterns in Go.

Here is an example of how you might use async and await to run a function concurrently in Go:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
    "sync"
)

func longRunningFunction() {
    fmt.Println("Starting long-running function...")
    time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("Finished long-running function")
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(1)
    go func() {
        defer wg.Done()
        longRunningFunction()
    }()
    fmt.Println("Hello from main function!")
    wg.Wait()
}
```
