# JavaScript 

**JavaScript** is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity to web pages. It is a client-side language, which means that it is executed by the web browser on the user's device, rather than on the server. JavaScript is often used to create things like interactive forms, dynamic menus, and to validate user input. It is a popular choice for building web applications and is supported by all modern web browsers. 

Some of the key features of JavaScript include:

1. Support for object-oriented programming and imperative programming styles
2. Support for functions and function closures
3. Dynamic typing
4. Support for asynchronous programming

To get started with JavaScript, you will need a text editor and a web browser. You can write JavaScript code in the text editor and then use the browser to run and test your code.
