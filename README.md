# Syllabus
- [*] **An Introduction of Go - why Go is worth learning.**
  - [*]  **What is Go?**
     Go, or Golang, is a programming language developed at Google. It has received a lot of acclaim from developers for its speed and straightforward syntax.
     **Build simple, secure, scalable systems**
    - An open-source programming language supported by Google
    - Easy to learn and great for teams
    - Built-in concurrency and a robust standard library
    - Large ecosystem of partners, communities, and tools
  - [*] Why Go is worth Learning 
        GoLang is a compiled multi-threaded programming language based on open source C and developed internally at Google. It is a single language that allows different processes to run simultaneously, which means simultaneous programming. Extremely fast, easy to maintain, and efficient, GoLang has all the advantages needed for **distributed systems** because it can handle **multiple parts of the blockchain concurrently.**
        The language was developed for **high-performance programs running** on modern **distributed systems** and **multicore processors**. Market participants perceived the launch of GoLang as an attempt to create a replacement for C/C ++. Today, the **Hyperledger Fabric blockchain** platform uses this programming language. It is often used in **NFT marketplace** development. 
        Examples of blockchain projects that use GoLang: **GoChain**, **Dero**, **Loom Network**, **Ethereum**, **Hyperledger Fabric**. .

- [*] The Go Toolchain - how to compile and run Go programs.
  - [*] **Setting Up Go Locally**
        Installing Go and Running Go Programs
        Developing Go locally on your own environment is a big step towards creating your very own Go projects and exercising your imagination!
        
        This guide will assume some knowledge of the **command line** and use of a code editor **(we recommend VSCode),** so brush up if you need too!

        First, [downland Go]() to your computer by going to Golang’s download page and select your operating system under the Featured downloads section.
