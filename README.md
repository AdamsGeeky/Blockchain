<summary>An Introduction of Go - why Go is worth learning</summary>

# Golang  **Build simple, secure, scalable systems**

- [x]  **What is Go?**
     Go, or Golang, is a programming language developed at Google. It has received a lot of acclaim from developers for its speed and straightforward syntax.
    - An open-source programming language supported by Google
    - Easy to learn and great for teams
    - Built-in concurrency and a robust standard library
    - Large ecosystem of partners, communities, and tools
  - [x] Why Go is worth Learning 
        GoLang is a compiled multi-threaded programming language based on open source C and developed internally at Google. It is a single language that         allows different processes to run simultaneously, which means simultaneous programming. Extremely fast, easy to maintain, and efficient, GoLang           has all the advantages needed for **distributed systems** because it can handle **multiple parts of the blockchain concurrently.**
        The language was developed for **high-performance programs running** on modern **distributed systems** and **multicore processors**. Market               participants perceived the launch of GoLang as an attempt to create a replacement for C/C ++. Today, the **Hyperledger Fabric blockchain**               platform uses this programming language. It is often used in **NFT marketplace** development. 
        Examples of blockchain projects that use GoLang: **GoChain**, **Dero**, **Loom Network**, **Ethereum**, **Hyperledger Fabric**. .
