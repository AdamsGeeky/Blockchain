n order to learn blockchain development, here is how you can do it. You can learn almost everything about blockchain within only 2–3 months.

I also put the time behind how long each point will probably take:

Setting up a node on a blockchain such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA, Nano (1-2 days each)
Understanding what a consensus algorithm is. Here I listed the 14 most used consensus algorithms these days. Current consensus algorithms (1–2 days)
Reading all of my 400 answers. As a blockchain developer it’s not only enough to program blockchains, you also need to know which things to developer, because some things are bad (permissioned and trusted networks, mining pool centralization). Reading all of my answers, gives you a very good overview of all things that are important around the blockchain gives, namely decentralization, scalability, security, all kinds of attacks, marketability of a blockchain, different blockchain technologies, advantages and disadvantages of blockchain technologies over one another, evolution of blockchains (1st gen, 2nd gen, 3rd gen), bad blockchain design choices, fallacies in blockchain design, removing emotional bias in blockchain technologies. (1-2 days)
Forking an existing blockchain, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum (3–5 days)
Forking a wallet ( 3 days)
Changing the consensus algorithm in your fork (1 week)
Setting up a testnet for that fork and putting it online (1-2 months)
Once, you have done that, you are already very far ahead in terms of blockchain development. There are probably less than 1,000 developers that have done the above things and there is currently a lot of demand for blockchain developers.

Currently blockchain developers are mostly only needed by people who want to start their own cryptocurrency, which aren’t that many.

Once banks, government, large companies will start to adopt blockchain, this need will explode, because blockchain will go into the mainstream.

If you want to complete your blockchain knowledge and know everything about blockchain development, you can also do these 2 things

Writing a smart contract and putting it online on a decent platform such as Ethereum, Elastos or Aeternity (3–5 days)
Writing a dapp and putting it online on a decent smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, Elastos or Aeternity (2–4 weeks)
Then you are probably among the most experienced 200 blockchain developers worldwide and very in demand.

Conclusion

So, these are the steps to become a real blockchain developer. This all only takes 2–3 months in total, so the learning curve is very steep.

I believe blockchain developers will be the developers most in demand in 2 years, so it’s definitely a worthwhile investment.

The best way to learn this is by joining a blockchain company, so this way you will actually get paid.

There are only a few dozen blockchain companies per country right now, but they are looking for good developers all the time.

Some good ones are

Whitecodelabs in California
NetObjex Inc. in California
Advanced Blockchain in Germany
Brainbot in Germany
iKantam in Minsk
They all already have several blockchain projects and some also a couple of ICOs under their belt and are looking for good developers.
